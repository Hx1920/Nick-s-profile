<h2><span style="color: #333399;">Interest In IT</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most of the people in IT area, my interest to IT or say interest in things related to computers begin with computer games. I was very obsessed of computer game since I was young. My parents constrained me a lot on games, so I don't get much chance to play games for a whole afternoon and dive into them, yet I was already fascinated by the how the characters in the games are operate by me and the excite of being able to do amazing things in games which you cannot think about in real life. For instance, CS was the first game I played on computers. When I finally got a chance to play the game, I was entirely obsessed with it. With the super emulational guns and the addictive feeling of striking, I was totally suck into the game. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I grow older, I got more chance to spend time in front of computers and &nbsp;tried diverse types of games. At the same time, I was also getting more and more interested in the world of computers and IT. Question like how the game creators create games always come up in my mind, and of course I also dreamed about being one of them.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>My perception on IT</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the recent years, IT area is developing in a rapid speed. In my opinion, every emerging production or technology relies on IT, particularly network, because we are all talk about getting connected. Homeport, smart TV, smart watch, all of these productions are talking about collecting your personal information like your daily behaviors, preferences, sending these information to terminal, analysing them and come up with a solution which suit you the best or say make your life better. Therefore, IT having been so related to our lives, and I think it is also the base of the further development of human beings, and this is why I choose to study IT, for being practically involve in it instead of just enjoying the outcomes. </span></p>

<h1><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><em>HELLO GUYS</em></strong></span></h1>
<h1><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><em>THIS IS NICK'S PROFILE</em></strong></span></h1>
<h2><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Personal Information</strong></span></h2>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Nick Ou, my student number in RMIT is 3776238, and my personal email address is nickou1920@gamail.com. &nbsp;I am from Guangzhou, where locates at the southern part of China and near Hong Kong. I am 19 now and I am currently at the first year in RMIT university in Melbourne for Bachelor of Information Technology. &nbsp;My hobby is gaming, and playing sport like table tennis and badminton. I can speak three languages which are Mandarin, Cantonese and English. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an international student, I have beenickou1920@gamail.comn studying in Australia for three year. Firstly I came to Melbourne and spent half a year on English ability at a language school. Then I joined the local students from year 11 and also took the VCE exam, in this way, I began my university life in RMIT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are one interesting fact about how I am crazy about games recently, which is that I finished the game Sekiro , the new game from FromSoftware for all endings just three days afters it released, and I played the game to six in the morning for two days. </span></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Interest In IT</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most of the people in IT area, my interest to IT or say interest in things related to computers begin with computer games. I was very obsessed of computer game since I was young. My parents constrained me a lot on games, so I don't get much chance to play games for a whole afternoon and dive into them, yet I was already fascinated by the how the characters in the games are operate by me and the excite of being able to do amazing things in games which you cannot think about in real life. For instance, CS was the first game I played on computers. When I finally got a chance to play the game, I was entirely obsessed with it. With the super emulational guns and the addictive feeling of striking, I was totally suck into the game. Therefore, games clearly bring me the interest of IT, it makes me pay more attention on emerging IT products and technology, and it makes me learn about how to assemble a PC to upgrade my gaming experience which I did try and obtain a large amount of knowledge about computer parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I grow older, I got more chance to spend time in front of computers and &nbsp;tried diverse types of games. At the same time, I was also getting more and more interested in the world of computers and IT. Question like how the game creators create games always come up in my mind, and of course I also dreamed about being one of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have mentioned before, I took VCE in Australia, When I was looking for the university I want to go, I noticed that RMIT is a university that really good at IT and by comparing the course structure with other universities, I think the one in RMIT suit my expectation the most. The study to me is tend to be more practical and easy to understand, which is the direction I want to go as a person have no foundation of IT. Although what I achieved in VCE is much above the requirement of the course, I decided to stay on my initially decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this Information Technology course in RMIT, I firstly expect to get some basic information of the &nbsp;IT industry, like the knowledge we currently learning in the course Introduction of Information Technology. Secondly, I want to learn the practical skill like programming using java language and managing database using SQL language, and this is also what we are exactly studying these courses. With these computer skills and knowledge of &nbsp;the emerging IT industry, I suppose I could be a professional IT person to pursue my own desire on games in my jobs and contribute my effort at the gaming area in IT industry. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My perception on IT</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the recent years, IT area is developing in a rapid speed. In my opinion, every emerging production or technology relies on IT, particularly network, because we are all talk about getting connected. Homeport, smart TV, smart watch, all of these productions are talking about collecting your personal information like your daily behaviors, preferences, sending these information to terminal, analysing them and come up with a solution which suit you the best or say make your life better. Therefore, IT having been so related to our lives, and I think it is also the base of the further development of human beings, and this is why I choose to study IT, for being practically involve in it instead of just enjoying the outcomes. </span></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h2><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Ideal Job</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As game is my great interest in IT, I really want to be a game designer, or at least at the area related to game. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By looking up jobs associated with games on Seek, I found a job wish I think suit my desire the best, which is a Game Mathematician. Although it does not heard like much into creating a game directly, it is going to be an occupation that help the team to manage and analysis the data from the plays&rsquo; game play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Game Mathematician is at the position which is going to be responsible for all math model calculations for assigned games, including return to player percentage, hit frequencies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">standard deviations, and other metrics as appropriate. In an other word, it is about the data of players&rsquo; performance, how is the game in the market, analysis, and review the product with the game design team to improve players&rsquo; game play experiences. I think this job suit me because in my opinion this is a great opportunity for me to step in the game industry. What I need to do is just making rational analysis </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the data related to the game instead of literally designing the direction of the game, which I think is a position needs more experience and knowledge on the game industry. Additionally, as I get touch the data and my use of them more, I can then come up with my own perspective of the industry and dive deeper and maybe become a true game designer one day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The requirement of this position is like such:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sourse from https://www.seek.com.au/job/38515963?searchrequesttoken=7e52d2aa-3005-4499-9e99-eaa594c16b84&amp;type=standard</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bachelor Degree (or higher) with a strong mathematical component;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proficiency in Excel;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming skills desirable (C++ preferred);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excellent communication skills (written and verbal);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to work well in a team environment;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong attention to detail;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creativity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and the third requirements are the clear ones I am now achieving with visible progress. With skill of excellent communication, I currently do not think I can do well in this as English is my second language. However I have been trying to improve my English skill for these past years in Australia. To keep the progress, I will try to make more local friends and practise my communication in English, and I hope my communication skill can match the requirement at the time when I graduate. With the ability to work well in a team environment, this is really the part I am lack at as the different education style in China. However, I notice that there will be many cooperational work and assignment in university. For instance, I have been work in a group for assignment 1 in the course UCD and for the upcoming assignment 2 in Introduction of Information Technology, it is also in the form of teamwork. With these chances of practicing cooperation, I will will try my best to complete my distributed work, share my idea with the teammates as well as listen to different opinions from them and finish the jobs together as a group. For the last two requirement which are attention to details and creativity, I think I have gotten these skills at some stage. I am a person who can dive really deep into events which I am interested in. For example, when I was learning input type of java like String, Int and so on, to clear identify them, I spent a whole night on Ellipse by putting values in my random makeup program. Thus as long as I keep my enthusiasm in IT, I think I can do well in details.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the learning style test Education Planner, my style is as such:</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual: 50%</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Big Five Personality test, I am defined as a empathic idealist</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/11697/test-results/7431576"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.truity.com/personality-test/11697/test-results/7431576</span></a></p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the result of the above tests, it is distinctly shown that I tend to be a introverted person, and I also good at thinking and logic. I actually quite agree with the results, instead of staying in the crowd along and start socializing, I would rather prefer finding a quiet place to stay. About the way I think, I think I have the ability to perceive in deep level, as long as I got the interest, so the point for me to do well is just to develop my interest in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When theses come to teamwork, I think introvert is not a good attribute which will definitely have negative influence on my performance for the team. It is possible that &nbsp;I am not able to share my great idea with the team just because I am shy or I feel bad when speaking in public. This is the problem I need to overcome because I know the importance of cooperation in most of the projects, but I think it would really takes time for me to have enough experience. However, for not having too much negative influence to the team as an entity, I might just go find my friends or people who I am familiar with when it comes to forming team. Indeed, I can perform fairly well in the environment I feel comfortable to. </span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Project idea</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project I am thinking about is to make a Side-scrolling video game on mobile phones. However instead of a horizontal plane like most on the market, mine will be a curved surface, and the idea is a man running on the surface on the moon. For summary, the players just need to touch their phones&rsquo; screen to control the character to either jump or squat to overcome the the terrain and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to arrive the checkpoints. There will be ten levels and the difficulty will increase with the increase of the levels. Since the design of the game is very simple and it is familiar with most of the Side-scrolling video game you can see everywhere, I will design the game to be extremely difficult as its feature</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a game lover, I really hope that the first project I make in the course is a game, because I think is game bring me my interest in IT, therefore it will be a very memorable thing to create a game. The idea of the game is motivate by the game you can play on google page when there chrome cannot connect to the internet. Although it is just an extremely simple game even without colors, it is still attractive to me and I cannot stop clicking the dinosaur to play once when that page come out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game I am going to design will be called &ldquo;Astronaut&rdquo;, as the character players need to control is an astronaut. This is going to be a Side-scrolling video game with extremely simple control method. The astronaut in the game will stay at the same position on the screen all the way and the background which is a little curved part of the moon surface with pits and &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite in the sky </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will keep rotating anticlockwise to make the astronaut appear to running on the surface of the moon. The players just need to tap their phone screens to control him to jump or squat depend on the conditions to avoid the pit and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While play the game, there will be just two control, which is to tap the left half side of the phone screen to squat or tap the right half side to jump. Ten levels of the game is divided into four stages. Whenever the astronaut drop into the pit or collide with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the player need to start from level one again. The first three levels are included in the the first stage which will just include some pits where players need to jump through. As the level increase from one to three, the speed of the rotation of the moon will get faster and the there will also be more pits that need to avoid falling, which require a rapid reaction of control on players. In stage two which include from level four to six, floating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite at different level above the moon surface</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> start appearing, so the players not only need to deal with the terrain but also need to either jump or squat depend on the hight of the floating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite to avoid making contact with them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Like in stage one, the speed the rotation of the moon will increase and the number of floating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> denser to enhance the difficulty. At the third stage which include from level seven to nine, flying </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite towards the astronaut will also be added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, therefore player will see the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite flying to the astronaut in different speed, and really need to think of how to dodge all of them in a half a second</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At this stage, all the element including pits, floating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite and flying</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite have appeared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The increase of difficulty in this stage will be similar to stage one and two which are by speeding up the rotation of the moon and the element. The last stage in level ten, which will be the boss of the game. With all the previous elements remained, an extremely dense </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meteorite bullet screen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be added. The player need to try their best to avoid all of them and pay attention to the pits on the surface as well. At the time when the astronaut arrive the checkpoint which is a rocket in level ten, there will be an ending cg of him jumping into the the rocket and flying back to earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no experience in making game or using any game making application before, however, I think the main software I am going to use is Unity, and Another software I can think of is Photoshop. Because I need to create the background and all the visual elements in the game. However, I will not design all the element myself, I will also search for some of the images and make use of them after editing. The hardware I will use to complete the game will just be my personal computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main skill be usage of &nbsp;Unity, which I need to learn. Another skill that will be require is the usage of PhotoShop, which is going to be used to create some visual elements for the presentation of the game. For all the skills required for this project, I need to learn them myself as I have no experience in any of it. However since Side-scrolling game should be a very basic game type, I think it will not be too difficult to learn the skills and complete the project.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the project is successful, the outcome will be a new Side-scrolling game in the market with feature of high difficulty. By completing this project of making a simple game, I think the greatest positive impact of me is learning the basic skills of using Unity and PhotoShop. With these skills, I might continue making simple games as interest to improve. Additionally, it will mean so much to me to succeed in making my own game, and it will definitely enhance my interest in IT</span></p>
